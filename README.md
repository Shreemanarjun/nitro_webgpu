# nitro_webgpu

WebGPU for Flutter, powered by [wgpu-native](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu-native)
and bound through [Nitro](https://pub.dev/packages/nitro) FFI.

One shared C++ implementation (`src/HybridNitroWebgpu.cpp`) wraps the standard
`webgpu.h` C ABI on all five native platforms (iOS, Android, macOS, Windows,
Linux). The public Dart API is a curated, Dart-idiomatic layer — not a 1:1
binding of the ~400-function WebGPU C API.

## Status

Early development.

- **M0 (done)**: wgpu-native linked — instance creation + version query.
- **M1 (done on macOS)**: adapter/device acquisition, error scopes +
  uncaptured-error/device-lost streams, buffers (write/mapRead), WGSL shader
  modules with checked creates, compute pipelines + dispatch, offscreen
  render passes + texture readback. 14 integration tests green; Linux/Windows
  CI jobs authored, pending first run.
- **M2.0 + M2.1 (done on macOS + iOS simulator)**: presentation — the
  `WebGpuView` widget composites WebGPU-rendered frames into the widget tree
  via Flutter's texture registry, pipelined 3 frames deep with backpressure.
  On Metal the frame is a single GPU→GPU blit into an IOSurface-backed pixel
  buffer (no CPU readback); a portable CPU-readback presenter is the
  automatic fallback. The full test suite passes on the iOS simulator with
  the Metal path active.
- **Textures + samplers (done)**: `queue.writeTexture`, samplers with
  filter/address modes, and texture/sampler bind-group entries — sampled
  textures work end-to-end in render passes.
- **3D rendering (done)**: vertex + index buffers with attribute layouts,
  instancing, depth testing (`depth24plus`/`depth32float`), alpha/additive/
  premultiplied blend presets, and explicit bind-group/pipeline layouts —
  real mesh rendering, verified by readback tests. Next: Android (M2.3),
  Windows/Linux (M2.4/M2.5), viewport/scissor + texture copies + MSAA.
- Flutter Web (`navigator.gpu` via JS interop) is designed-for but deferred.

Known upstream gaps (wgpu-native v29.0.1.1): the device-lost callback never
fires (the `onLost` stream is plumbed and will work once upstream delivers
events); unbalanced `popErrorScope` would abort the process, so the plugin
tracks scope depth natively and throws a Dart error instead.

## Setup (contributors)

The wgpu-native static libraries are vendored, not committed. After cloning:

```sh
scripts/fetch_wgpu_native.sh          # fetches targets for your host OS
```

This downloads the pinned wgpu-native release (see `scripts/wgpu_native.sha256`),
verifies checksums, unpacks into `src/third_party/wgpu_native/`, and on macOS
also produces the Apple `wgpu_native.xcframework` bundles.

Regenerate bindings after editing `lib/src/nitro_webgpu.native.dart`:

```sh
scripts/gen.sh    # build_runner + swift-bridge workaround + nitrogen link/doctor
```

## Example

```sh
cd example
flutter test integration_test -d macos
flutter run -d macos
```
